  displayName: Surf Smelt
  description: "At dusk, just as the surf fades to twilight, schools of surf smelt
    emerge along sandy beaches, flickering silver in the shallows like living moonlight.
    They spawn in the breaker zone: tiny sticky eggs cling to wet sand and kelp,
    laid under the cover of night to the rhythm of crashing surf. Each spring through
    fall, they rise and fall with the tides, feeding the entire beach ecosystem\u2014from
    diving seabirds to local halibut and salmon. These slender smelts are modest
    in size but immense in impact\u2014beach anglers prize them as bait, but in their
    own right they are a vital thread weaving sea and sand together."
