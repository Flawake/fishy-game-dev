  description: "The mandarinfish (Synchiropus splendidus) lives in the warm reefs
    of the Indo-Pacific, often hiding in coral crevices during the day. Its vivid
    blue color comes from light-reflecting cells called iridophores, not pigments
    \u2014 a rare trait in fish. At dusk, males perform a short mating dance with
    females. Lacking scales, it protects itself with a foul-smelling, toxic mucus
    that deters predators. Though only about 6 cm long, its striking appearance and
    secretive behavior have made it both a scientific marvel and a reef legend."
