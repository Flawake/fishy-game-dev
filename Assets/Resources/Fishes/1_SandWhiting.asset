  displayName: Sand Whiting
  description: "By dawn, schools of slender, silvery whiting slide beneath breaking
    waves, skimming sandy shallows where ocean meets beach. Locals say they dance
    the surf: turning tail and nose-up as a signal that the tide has turned. With
    a pointed snout and keen nose, they sift the seabed for worms, crabs, and pipis
    with a mesmerising head-down shuffle. When startled, they vanish\u2014burrowing
    quickly into the sand, leaving no trace. Despite their humble appearance, they\u2019ve
    long been coveted by anglers for their fight and flavour. In their world, beauty
    is subtle and utilitarian\u2014moving in synchrony, half\u2011invisible in foam
    and sunlit ripples."
